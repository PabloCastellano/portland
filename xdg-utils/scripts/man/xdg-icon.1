.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show the xdg\-utils version information\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-noupdate\fR
Postpone updating the desktop icon system\&. If multiple icons are added in sequence this flag can be used to indicate that additional changes will follow and that it is not necassery to update the desktop icon system right away\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-theme\fR \fItheme\fR
Installs or removes the icon file as part of \fItheme\fR\&. If no theme is specified the icons will be installed as part of the default \fIhicolor\fR theme\&. Applications may install icons under multiple themes but should at least install icons for the default \fIhicolor\fR theme\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-context\fR \fIcontext\fR
Specifies the context for the icon\&. Icons to be used in the application menu and as desktop icon should use \fIapps\fR as context which is the default context\&. Icons to be used as file icons should use \fImimetypes\fR as context\&. Other common contexts are \fIactions\fR, \fIdevices\fR, \fIemblems\fR, \fIfilesystems\fR and \fIstock\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR
Installs or uninstalls the icon for the current user only\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-system\fR
Installs or uninstalls the icon for all users on the system\&. Usually only root is allowed to do this\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR \fIsize\fR
Specifies the size of the icon (for png and xpm icons only)\&. All icons must be square\&. Common sizes for icons in the apps context are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128\&. Common sizes for icons in the mimetypes context are: 16, 22, 32, 48, 64 and 128

.TP
\fB\-\-install\fR \fIicon\-file\fR
Installs the icon file indicated by \fIicon\-file\fR to the desktop icon system\&. The icon file must have the \fI\&.png\fR, \fI\&.xpm\fR or \fI\&.svg\fR as extension\&. If a corresponding \fI\&.icon\fR file exists in the same location as \fIicon\-file\fR it will be installed as well\&.

Removes the icon file indicated by \fIicon\-file\fR from the desktop icon system\&.

.TP
