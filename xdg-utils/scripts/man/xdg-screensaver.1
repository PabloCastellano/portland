.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
xdg\-screensaver provides commands

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fBsuspend \fIdelay\fR\fR
Suspends the screensaver and monitor power management for the amount of time given by \fIdelay\fR, or 60 minutes if unspecified\&. This is of the form NUMBERSUFFIX, such as 45m, 4h, or 30s\&. SUFFIX may be `s' for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days This is intended to allow preventing the screensaver coming on during a presentation, and return it to normal behavior after the specified delay\&.

.TP
\fBrestore\fR
Restores the screensaver state, timeout, etc\&. to the user's standard settings\&.

.TP
\fBenable\fR
This enables the screensaver to turn on after a certain amount of inactivity\&. Generally, applications will want to use \fBrestore\fR rather than \fBenable\fR\&.

.TP
\fBdisable\fR
Disables the screensaver and power management from turning on due to inactivity\&.

.TP
\fBactivate\fR
Turns the screensaver on immediately\&.

.TP
\fBreset\fR
Turns the screensaver off immediately\&.

.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Returns true if the screensaver is enabled to turn on after a period of inactivty, or false otherwise\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Show the xdg\-utils version information\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
 

.nf

xdg\-screensaver suspend 3h

.fi
 Causes the screensaver to not turn on due to inactivity, for 3 hours, after which time it will return to automatic activation\&.

.SH "BUGSS"

.PP
There is no provision for cancelling a suspend operation\&. If a second suspend is started before the first one is completed, then the screensaver will be restored to its original state before the second suspend is able to complete\&.

.PP
For example, if a presenter completes her presentation, and a second presenter starts before the delay is over, then the screensaver could come on during the second presentation\&.

.PP
True suspend functionality will require cooperation from the X server\&. The Xorg group has implemented an extension that allows an application to disable the screensaver while it is connected, which will re\-enable the screensaver\&. xdg\-screensaver should be updated to take advantage of this functionality when it is available\&.
