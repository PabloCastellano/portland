README: xdg-utils tests

Created 6/27/2006 by Tom Whipple <tom.whipple@intel.com>


RUNNING XDG-UTILS TESTS
-----------------------
At a minimum, you must have your current directory be the same as the directory containing this README. Then, simply execute

$ ./testrun
WARNING: guessed XDG_TEST_DIR to be /home/tw/portland/xdg-utils/tests
TEST_LIST:  generic_bogus_arg-1-1 ... generic_version-1-50
...
FAIL: test_user_mime_install
NORESULT: test_system_mime_install
71 of 92 tests passed. (114 attempted)
See xdg-test.log for details.
NOT OK!

FAIL     indicates (not suprisingly) a test failure. 
NORESULT indicates that the test prerequisites failed for some reason. 
         (e.g. the install phase of an uninstall test failed)
UNTESTED means that something needed was not found. This is fine and should be ignored. 
         These tests are not counted in the total, only attempted. 
         (e.g. test requires root, but we are not running as root)

NOTE: The test runner makes guesses about appropriate values of XDG_TEST_DIR and PATH. These values can be overriden explicitly.

To run tests individually, or as smaller groups do something like

$ ./testrun xdg-mime

OR

$ ./testrun xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install

OR (if you have defined XDG_TEST_DIR and PATH correctly)

$ xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install


BACKUPS
-------
THESE TESTS CHANGE YOUR USER ENVIRONMENT. Effort is made to keep pollution to a minimum, but we make no guarantees!! Back up your environment/system early and often. This is especially critical if you run tests as root. You have been warned. 


INTERACTIVE TESTS
-----------------
Because it is difficult to verify the way things appear to the user, some tests are interactive and require the user to verify or perform actions. This is sometimes annoying, so interactive tests can be disabled with the -I flag.


PRIVLAGED TESTS
---------------
BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM. See above.

Some tests require root (e.g. those commands with a --system option). So, tests in this group return UNTESTED if they are not run as root. You MAY use sudo, but be aware that some tests may fail since the environment does not get reset. It is recommended to use su - to reset the environment.


CLEANUP
-------
Tests should clean up after themselves. However, this sometimes fails, so use
'sudo make tests-clean' or 'make tests-userclean'. (Note that you must have generated a makefile via 'cd .. && ./configure' at some point.) 

 
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------
xdg-*		tests for each util
include		"library" code used by most tests
generic		generic tests to be run on most utilities. See xdg-mime/t.apply_generic


WRITING XDG-UTILS TESTS
-----------------------
See xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install as an example.

Each test is as follows

test_function() {		-- Tests are functions for TET integration.

test_start "test description"	-- required to begin a test
test_purpose "verbose text"	-- optionally provide a verbose description. not used.
test_init			-- optionally begin a prerequisite section. assertions
				   that fail here cause NORESULT rather than FAIL
<pre-assertions>
test_procedure			-- required to begin the actuall test assertions
<test-assertions>

test_result			-- required to generate result codes. Must be last.
}

run_test test_function
  - OR -
repeat_test test_function NVARS V1 ... VN V1val1 ... V1valM ... VNval1 ... VNvalM
				-- one of the above is required. 
				   see inlcude/testcontrol.sh for detail
