README: xdg-utils tests

Created 6/27/2006 by Tom Whipple <tom.whipple@intel.com>

To run a test suite, assuming your current directory is the same as this README, ensure you have defined TEST_CODE_DIR.

$ export TEST_CODE_DIR=`pwd`

Then, run the test runner with the suite(s) as an argument.

$ ./testrun xdg-mime
NORESULT: xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install
2 of 3 tests passed.
See xdg-test.log for details.

In this example we see that the user_mime_install had an error, so run it separately:

$ xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install
[Tue Jun 27 14:53:23 PDT 2006] xdg-mime/t.user_mime_install: user mime install: NORESULT
<...>
Initilization failed!

In this case, a test depencency failed, so NORESULT is given instead of FAIL.
