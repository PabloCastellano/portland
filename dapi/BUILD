make -f Makefile.cvs
./configure
make

For KDE module:
cd kde
make -f Makefile.cvs
./configure
make

If you have a serious problem with the -Werror flag, edit configure.ac
and kde/configure.in.in (sorry, but plain C accepts unbelievable nonsense
without it). I should be probably turned into a configure switch or something.
