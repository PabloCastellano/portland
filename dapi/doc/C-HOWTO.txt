                           C API bindings HOWTO
==============================================================================

This file contains HOWTO information specific to the C bindings. Refer to the generic
API documentation for information that is not specific to C bindings and to
C-API.txt for description of C bindings.


Note: Most test programs in tests/ can be also used as examples.


Linking with the library
========================


Use #include <dapi/headerfile.h> and add proper include path flags for the compiler
if necessary.

Add -ldapi and proper library path flags for the linker if necessary.



Handling the DAPI connection
============================


Before using any API calls it is necessary to initialize the DAPI connection first.

static DapiConnection* my_dapi_connection = NULL;
...
int initializeDapi()
    {
    my_dapi_connection = dapi_connectAndInit();
    if( my_dapi_connection == NULL )
        return 0; /* oops, failure */
    return 1;
    }

If you want to do more than just perform a simple blocking call, you need to watch
the connection for activity. Use dapi_socket() to get the file descriptor to watch
and call dapi_processData().

void mainloop()
   {
   fd_set in;
   FD_ZERO( &in );
   ... all file descriptors the app wants to watch
   FD_SET( dapi_socket( my_dapi_connection ), &in );
   ... select() call here
   if( FD_ISSET( dapi_socket( my_dapi_connection ), &in ))
       dapi_processData( my_dapi_connection );
   ...
   }

Closing of the connection is done using dapi_close();



Blocking calls
==============


For blocking calls, just simply call the matching API function. For example, to open
URL in a browser:

int openURL( const char* url )
    {
    if( dapi_OpenUrl_Window( my_dapi_connection, url, XWINDOW_HANDLE( toplevel_widget )))
        return 1;
    ... failure
    }


OpenUrl call needs a toplevel window in which the request originated (to handle properly
window relations and focus). It is strongly discouraged to omit this information.
If the application has no window at all, use 0. Note a convenience _Window function is
used instead of DapiWindowInfo and dapi_windowInfoInitWindow().


Functions are responsible for freeing resources allocated by the call. For example
when converting KDE's media:/ URL to a local file:

void handle_media_url( const char* url )
    {
    char* local;
    /* convert to local file, don't allow download to a temporary file */
    local = dapi_LocalFile_Window( my_dapi_connection, url, NULL, 0, XWINDOW_HANDLE( toplevel_widget ));
    if( local != NULL ) /* success */
        {
        handle_local_file( local );
        free( local );
        return;
        }
    }


Callbacks
=========


Some calls such as downloading a remote file to a temporary local file may take long time
and as such should be processed asynchronously. It is possible to do so using the lowlevel
dapi_read/write function or using callbacks.

int start_downloading_remote_url( const char* url )
    {
    int seq = dapi_callbackLocalFile_Window( my_dapi_connection, url, NULL, 1, XWINDOW_HANDLE( toplevel_widget ),
        download_remote_url_callback );
    if( seq != 0 )
        return seq;
    ... failure
    }

void download_remote_url_callback( DapiConnection* conn, int seq, const char* result )
    {
    /* if this callback is used for more calls, use seq and the value returned from dapi_callbackLocalFile_Window
       to identify matching command and reply */
    if( result[ 0 ] != '\0' )
        ... success
    else
        ... failed to download
    }


NOTE: Callbacks should not deallocate any of its arguments, callback handling will perform this
automatically after the callback returns.


Fallbacks
=========


API calls may fail for various reasons: No backend daemon is running or it doesn't implement
the required functionality.

No backend daemon running
-------------------------

TODO: fallback daemons don't make sense, the library should try to implement fallbacks


Some functionality not available
--------------------------------

It is possible to query functionality provided by the backend daemon.

int is_openurl_supported()
    {
    intarr capabilities;
    int i;
    if( dapi_Capabilities( conn, &capabilities ))
        {
        int has_openurl = 0;
        for( i = 0;
             i < capabilities.count;
             ++i )
            {
            if( capabilities.data[ i ] == DAPI_COMMAND_OPENURL )
                has_openurl = 1;
            }
        }
    return has_openurl;
    }

See dapi/comm_generated.h for list of command ids (DAPI_COMMAND_MAILTO for MailTo call etc.)

Applications may perform one Capabilities call after initializing connection and query for all
required functionality. If they don't find it available they may as well close this connection
and use a fallback daemon in order to expect all calls to succeed.


Fallback code
-------------

Another approach is to just initialize connection and test for failure after every call.

void openURL( const char* url )
    {
    if( !dapi_OpenUrl_Window( my_dapi_connection, url, XWINDOW_HANDLE( toplevel_widget )))
        openInHardcodedBrowser( url );
    }
