XDG_VFS_KDE
===========

!!! hint: to turn off the error messages run kdebugdialog !!!

xdg_vfs_kde is a command line client for KIO. It can read and write
files, list directories, open file-dialogs,... File-data is not stored in
temporary files, but instead is pushed/pulled via stdin and stdout.

The aim of 'xdg_vfs_kde' is to give third party desktop applications access
to KIO. It could be hidden behind a generic 'xdg_vfs' script, which switches between KIO, 
Gnome-VFS,... command line clients.


Samples:
========

-) reading a file

$ xdg_vfs_kde get file:///etc/lilo.conf

$ xdg_vfs_kde get http://www.freedesktop.org

will stream a remote file to stdout which could be read into the hosts
applications memory via the C-function popen(..,'r');

$ xdg_vfs_kde openfiledlg --instant-get

will open a file-dialog to browse to a remote or local file and instantly 
stream the file-data of the selected file to stdout.

$ xdg_vfs_kde openfiledlg --instant-get --qry-fileinfo --slow-mime --tagged

By adding those switches xdg_vfs_kde will also 'stat' the remote file and
try to detect it's mime-type, size,...

-) writing a file

$ cat /etc/passwd | xdg_vfs_kde put ftp://user@host/mydir/file.txt

or use something like popen(..,'w') to stream file-data to create a remote file.

-) listing a directory

$ xdg_vfs_kde ls sftp://user@host/dir/


There are two operation modes: 
==============================

*) single command 

*) shell mode (like the command-line ftp client). In shell mode the
   host application can talk to 'xdg_vfs_kde' by connecting to the
   stdin and stdout pipes to execute a sequence of vfs commands.
   (for instance QProcess or functions like g_spawn_async_with_pipes() allow
   connecting to stdin and stdout of a child process)

The advantage of shell mode is that passwords are kept in memory 
(the user doesn't have log in again and again) and avoiding startup-delay
when executing multiple commands (for instance if the client application
is a file-manager)

Tagged-mode:
============

the -t, --tagged option tells xdg_vfs_kde to add 'labels' when a command
returns multiple 'parts'. For instance 

> xdg_vfs_kde openfiledlg --instant-get --qry-fileinfo --tagged

will return an [OpenFileDlg], a [FileInfo] and a [Data] section.

Escaping file data:
===================

When operating in shell- or tagged- mode you will need an escape character 
to signal the end of binary data. This is done via the -e and --escape-data 
switch. By default '~' is the escape character. '~~' has to be treated as
single '~' and '~\n' as EOF. The escape-character can be changed by 
the -e35 or --escape-data=35 option. (when you want to use '#' ASCII 35 as escape
character)

Usage screen:
=============

Usage: xdg_vfs [command] [options] [filename]

  Commands:
      get  [filename]            : remote file->stdout
      info [file or dir]         : stat a remote file->stdout
      put  [filename]            : stdin->create remote file
      ls   [dir]                 : list directory
      openfiledlg [dir]          : show open file dialog and return selected file
      savefiledlg [dir] [fname]  : show save file dialog and return selected file
      shell                      : interactive mode

  Options:
      -t, --tagged               : tagged mode (file-data should be escaped)
      -i, --qry-fileinfo         : qry file-info when retrieving a file
      --show-metadata            : show metadata when retrieving a file
                                   requires tagged mode!
      -m, --slow-mime            : more accurate mime-type detection (slow)
      -e, --escape-data          : escape file data (for end of data detection)
      -eXXX, --escape-data=XXX   : set and use a user defined escape character
                                   XXX = ascii code!
      --end-seperator=           : add a custom seperator inbetween blocks
      --overwrite                : allow overwriting files (put)
      --instant-get              : openfiledilog instant get file->stdout
      --instant-put              : savefiledilog instant put file from stdin
