GNOME Integration for Project Portland:
=======================================

REPORTING PERIOD:
July 3rd 2006 - July 14th 2006

ACHIEVEMENTS/CLOSED ISSUES:
The daemon is implemented and all the functionality is in place. A few comments
have been brought up and are listed in the MISC section and will pasted in the
report email for discussion.

We have currently put the GNOME daemon in it's own package outside of the
generic/KDE build tree for easier split out and putting it in the GnomeCVS. If
it would be better to keep it in the Portland source tree for now it can be
adapted for that.

NEXT WEEKS/ISSUES IN PROGRESS:

Next week both Mikael Hallendal and Martyn Russell will be on vacation. The
week leading up to delivery will be used for testing and debugging of the
daemon.

PROBLEMS:
None.

MISC:
The OpenUrl and ExecuteUrl functionality is a bit odd, or at least the naming.
Suggestions would be OpenUrl (for the current ExecuteUrl functionality) and
OpenUrlInBrowser (for doing what OpenUrl does right now).
