About Dapi-GNOME:
=================
Dapi-GNOME is a daemon that implements the Dapi commands for GNOME. 

Requirements:
=============

* GLib2 >= 2.10.0
* Gtk+ >= 2.8.0
* GnomeVFS >= 2.0.0
* GConf >= 1.2.0
* EBook >= 1.6.1
* D-BUS >= 0.60
* D-BUS Glib >= 0.71

For unit tests Check 0.9.0 is required.

D-Bus:
======
You can use the D-Bus interface in the dapi-daemon with the dbus-send command.

For example:

  $ dbus-send --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.dapi /org/freedesktop/dapi \
    org.freedesktop.dapi.OpenUrl string:'http://www.imendio.com' \
    variant:string:''

    method return sender=:1.49 -> dest=:1.55

D-BUS Protocol:
===============
The protocol XML file can be found in data/dapi-command.xml

Activation:
===========
We currently install a service file to activate the daemon. This isn't
feasible when we have more than one implementation of the Dapi Daemon,
instead the desktop should be responsible for starting the correct
daemon which will register under the org.freedesktop.dapi namespace.

Running Tests:
==============
When running the tests/test-api application (which makes use of the
Check test suite) to extensively test the API over DBus, one of the
address book tests may fail on a cleanly built machine. This happens
because the "About Me" dialog in Gnome which is used to configure your
personal information will add the contact needed in Evolution Data
Server for all tests to succeed.

The upload-file API in DBus is not covered by these tests because it
doesn't test anything locally and so making a test case for that is
difficult.

You may find while running the tests or 'make check' that this error
is produced: 
   
  WARNING **: FIXME: wait for completion unimplemented

This is detailed in the bug link below and seems to be harmless:
