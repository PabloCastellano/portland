	* data/Makefile.am:
	* data/dapi-command.xml:
	* data/org.freedesktop.dapi.service.in:
	* data/org.gnome.dapi.service.in:
	* src/dapi-command.h:
	* tests/test-api.c:
	* tests/test-client.c: Renamed service to org.freedesktop.dapi
	from org.gnome.dapi.

2006-10-27  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	* data/dapi-command.xml:
	* src/dapi-command.[ch]: 
	* tests/test-api.c: 
	* tests/test-client.c: Re-added 'windowinfo' parameter now we know
	that DBus doesn't NULL check variants either (of type GValue*).

	* src/Makefile.am:
	* tests/Makefile.am: Use CLEANFILES not CLEAN_FILES so we actually
	do clean up the bindings generated source files.

	* acinclude.m4:
	* configure.ac:
	* data/Makefile.am:
	* data/org.gnome.dapi.service.in: Added service files needed to
	start dbus daemon if it is not already started.

2006-10-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	* src/dapi-command.c:
	* src/dapi-gnome.[ch]: Added additional checks in dapi-command.c
	for the incoming variables from dbus, since NULL parameters are
	passed as "" for G_TYPE_STR, this means checking for NULL is not
	sufficient, we also need to check for empty strings. 
	
	* tests/test-api.c: Comment out the run_as_user failure check
	because we know that it won't return FALSE due to the way gksu
	works and there is no point in checking something we know is going
	to fail.

2006-10-26  Mikael Hallendal  <micke@imendio.com>

	* src/dapi-command.c: (dbus_finalize): 
	- Use dapi_command_parent_class instead of parent_class.

	* ChangeLog-pre-1.0: Removed.
		
2006-10-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	* src/dapi-command.c: 
	* tests/test-api.c:
	* tests/test-client.c: Fixed the const gchar ** attachments
	crashers that were occuring in the tests, dbus doesn't NULL check
	G_TYPE_STRV before doing something with it and it crashes in dbus
	somewhere.

2006-10-23  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* tests/Makefile.am:
	* tests/test-api.c: Added to test the API with Check, the test
	suite tool.
